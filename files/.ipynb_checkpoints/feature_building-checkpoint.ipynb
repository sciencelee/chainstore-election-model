The dataset also contains information on territories (Guam, NMI, PR, etc.) but that will be filtered out to focus on the contiguous United States and Hawaii.  The burroughs of Alaska are unfortunately not part of this dataset, although after looking at the frequency of stores in Alaska, it might  not be useful to add to the model as many of these stores are not present or sparse in our 49th state.  District of Columbia is unfortunately not included.  Adding the Alaskan burroughs and DC would be a recommendation for further study."
