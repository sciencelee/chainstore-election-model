    "The chain stores found in a community can tell us a lot about the people that live there. Think about Target and Walmart; what political party do you associate with each? I wanted to investigate that perception, so I built an election model based solely on the number of chain stores in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that the number of total chain stores can predict Democratic and Republican winners in political districts significantly better than guessing. Additionally, the particular chain store/brand will be an indicator of Republican or Democratic winners.\n",

    "## Future Use\n",
    "This method can be improved through the following methods:\n",
    "- Build several smaller targeted models based on regional or more homogenous voting blocks (Midwest, Arizona/New Mexico, California, Pacific Northwest, Florida etc.)\n",
    "- Evaluate data at the state level, congressional district level, or down to the precinct level with similar methodology. A preliminary model at the congressional district level predicted US House races with over 80% accuracy.\n",
    "- Add or change features that target the shortcomings of our model. Find what businesses are prevalent in the missed counties.\n",
    "- Build models specifically for identifying purple districts where further investment might yield political seats.\n"
