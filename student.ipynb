    "## Overview\n",
    "The chain stores found in a community can tell us a lot about the people that live there. Think about Target and Walmart; what political party do you associate with each? I wanted to investigate that perception, so I built an election model based solely on the number of chain stores in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that the number of total chain stores can predict Democratic and Republican winners in political districts significantly better than guessing. Additionally, the particular chain store/brand will be an indicator of Republican or Democratic winners.\n",

    "- Election result (Democrat/Republican)\n",
    "- County Area\n",
    "- County Population \n",

    "- Political boundary maps for counties and/or congressional districts US \n",
    "- Results of 2018 midterm election \n",

    "1. Gather all of our store, geodata, and county data using existing datasets and scraping. \n",

    "3. Add in columns for population and area of each county from data.gov data, and match up FIPS data used for mapping.\n",
    "4. Go through each of our 20 store datasets, and find the number of stores in each district.  Add it to our dataset\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This model focuses on Democratic ‘upmarket’ retail (Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Starbucks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model performs poorly in regions where other factors might be more important (demographics, unique candidates, regional leanings )\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Advantages\n",
    "- Independent of census or polling\n",
    "- Readily available data (updated more easily than polling or census)\n",
    "- Responds to demographic changes \n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Use\n",
    "This method can be improved through the following methods:\n",
    "- Build several smaller targeted models based on regional or more homogenous voting blocks (Midwest, Arizona/New Mexico, California, Pacific Northwest, Florida etc.)\n",
    "- Evaluate data at the state level, congressional district level, or down to the precinct level with similar methodology. A preliminary model at the congressional district level predicted US House races with over 80% accuracy.\n",
    "- Add or change features that target the shortcomings of our model. Find what businesses are prevalent in the missed counties.\n",
    "- Build models specifically for identifying purple districts where further investment might yield political seats.\n"
